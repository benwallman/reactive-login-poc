# react-starter-kit
An opinionated react starter kit. Let's all do it my way


# TODO
 - Install & use react router, SPA's are the future
 - Install & use something for state. Redux & flux maybe?
 - Install & use rx.js. You ain't no amateur
 - Generate config at runtime, serve it with node server and retrieve w/ http method using rx
 - Invade Cuba
 - Implement styling, presumably SCSS. Use it properly
 - Create unit tests, allow them to be ran with npm commands
 - Create integration tests, allow them to be ran with npm commands
 - Create acceptance tests, headless chrome & firefox, maybe bound w/ docker-compose
 - Tidy up documentation, justify design choices
